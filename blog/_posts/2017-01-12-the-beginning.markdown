title: "The Beginning"

I've been looking into various web technologies lately - languages, frameworks, etc. - because I have a couple projects I want to do. This of course required hours of trawling the internet for posts on all these various technologies, and eventually bugging some of my friends and co-workers about technologies they liked. And despite it not being particularly useful for what I wanted, the conversations kept coming back to Jekyll.

So I decided to try it.

I've only just set up this blog, in about the last ten to twenty minutes since I got home from work, and I must say it's been very easy so far. I haven't done much - I don't even have any custom templates yet - but I didn't even have to heed the warning about Jekyll requiring extra steps to install on Windows.  I just installed Ruby (somehow I didn't have that on this computer yet?) and typed in the commands from Jekyll's home page.

I think the hardest thing so far has been working out how to make .markdown files because Windows won't let you do that via the right click -> New menu. Very annoying.

I'm going to start playing with templates now, see how that goes, but I wanted to have a couple posts to work with at least, so. Hopefully it continues to go so smoothly!
